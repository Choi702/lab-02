Feature #2: Filter images
Why are we implementing this feature?
As a user, I want to be able to filter the images so that I can view only images that match a keyword.
What are we going to implement?
Given that a user clicks on the dropdown menu When the user selects one of the options Then only the images whose keyword matches the option should be displayed

How are we implementing it?
Create a <select> element which contains unique <option> elements extracted dynamically from the JSON file, one for each keyword.
Use an event handler to respond when the user chooses an option from the select menu. Hide all of the images, then show those whose keyword matches the option chosen.

Feature #3: Style the application
Why are we implementing this feature?
As a user, I want a simple, clean looking UI so that my photo gallery clearly displays the images in a grid like pattern.
What are we going to implement?
Given that a user opens the application in the browser When the user navigates to the home page Then the images should be displayed in rows across the screen

How are we implementing it?
Style your application using floats.
Utilize at least one Google font.

Stretch Goal: Sort the images
Why are we implementing this feature?
As a user, I want to be able to sort the images so there is an order to how they render.
What are we going to implement?
Given that a user is presented with sort options When the user clicks on one option Then the images should be sorted accordingly

How are we implementing it?
Add the ability for the user to sort the images by either title or by number of horns.
Sort the images by one of the properties on page load. This should also apply to the second page of images.
